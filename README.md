# Weather Forecasting Project

This project focuses on predicting the next day's maximum temperature using historical weather data.  
The implementation is based on data analysis and a linear regression model.

## Dataset
- File: `local_weather.csv`
- Contains daily weather observations
- Key attributes include precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature

## Approach
- Clean and preprocess weather data
- Create rolling average and time-based features
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Run the Colab Notebook
